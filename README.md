# O-Shop-Front

You can found the API in the repository names "O-Shop-Back" or click this link https://github.com/FlorianFachaux/O-Shop-Back.

O'Shop is a merchandising site on which you can find all kinds of clothing and accessories for developers.

The basic project was created by a team of 5 people. 2 back developers, and 3 front developers, I am the product owner. 
Then once finished, I decided to take this project and rework it.
